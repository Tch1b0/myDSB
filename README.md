_The alternative you didn't ask for, but the one you deserve._

## Philosophy

_Why is your Smartphone called smart?_
Because it does stuff automatically _for_ you instead of just giving all the information crunched together.

**myDSB** is a kind of app that is supposed to actively **present** information to you.
